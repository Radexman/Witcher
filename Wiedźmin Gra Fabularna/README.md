# **Wither RPG**

## **Project Overview**
This project is still in development and it will take major refactoring.
Currently working functionalities: section “Bohaterowie” is fully accessible and was tested via live play of Witcher RPG.
Accessible hero cards with dice rolls skills, items and descriptions. All the assets and images are owned by CD Projekt Red Company,
I only used them for this NON-COMMERCIAL project and I have no financial benefits from it.
This project is the love letter to the Witcher universe which me and my friends adore so much that the idea of D&D Beyond for Witcher RPG came out.
